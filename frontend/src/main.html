  Now you can learn OpenFlow using a simple web browser. Flowsim is
  designed to simulate a wide range of standards compliant OpenFlow
  switch profiles. Choose a profile from any version of OpenFlow, or
  customize your own profiles. Watch packets step through the OpenFlow
  switch data plane's pipeline stages and learn exactly what is
  happening.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> Datapath</h3>
    <p>
    The datapath is the root abstraction of the OpenFlow data plane. All
    other data plane abstractions are child properties of the OpenFlow datapath.
    The datapath maintains fragmentation handling and packet buffering.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-database"></i> Flow Table</h3>
    <p>
    A flow table is a colleciton of flows that can be indexed in an independent
    manner.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-list"></i> Flow</h3>
    <p>
    A flow contains a set of matches, a set of instructions, and some metadata
    that helps manage the behavior and lifecycle of the flow.

    <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-th"></span> Port</h3>
    <p>
    Ports are a fundamental abstraction in the OpenFlow protocol. Mimic
    actual vendor switches with specific port counts and capabilities.
    Toggle port status during simulation to see port state changes and
    related OpenFlow messaging.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-crosshairs"></i> Match</h3>
    <p>
    Matches are OpenFlow's fundamental packet classification mechanism.
    Limit a switch's possible classifiers through a profile. Learn the
    details of multi-table flow matching by single steping a packet
    through the classification, or flow matching stage, of the OpenFlow
    data plane pipeline.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-bars"></i> Instruction</h3>
    <p>
    Limit a switch's possible policies through instruction and action
    capabilities on a profile. Learn the intracacies of instructions and
    actions by watching them in action. See how a packet is manipulated
    based on different instruction and action combinations.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-rotate-right"></i> Action</h3>
    <p>
    Limit a switch's possible policies through instruction and action
    capabilities on a profile. Learn the intracacies of instructions and
    actions by watching them in action. See how a packet is manipulated
    based on different instruction and action combinations.

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i> Group</h3>
    <p>
    Define a set of egress packet processing behaviors with a defined group. Use
    groups to load balance across targets, select the live target from a high 
    availability group, copy a packet to multiple destinations, or some other
    stuff.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-align-right"></i> Queue</h3>
    <p>
    Utilize rich egress queueing mechanisms on a per port basis for egress
    pcaket delivery.

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-dashboard"></i> Meter</h3>
    <p>
    Defing a policing or shaping strategy to meter any type of flow in the 
    dataplane. Use a policing strategy to limit flows to specific bandwidth
    cielings with excessive packets being discarded. Or use shapping strategies
    allow for bursts above a defined rate within the constraints of a specified
    queue depth.
