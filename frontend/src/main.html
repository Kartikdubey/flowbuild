  Now you can learn the OpenFlow data plane using a simple web browser. Flowsim
  is designed to simulate five different versions of the OpenFlow switch data
  plane. Create a switch profile based on a specific version of OpenFlow.
  Instantiate that profile and configure the resulting switch as a live OpenFlow
  device. Step packets through each stage of the data plane of your switch, and 
  see how the packet and your configuration interact at each stage in the
  pipeline.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> Datapath</h3>
    <p>
    Constrain a switch's data plane fragmentation and packet buffering abilities
    through the datapath profile. Manipulate the data plane's fragmentation
    handling behaviors through the datapath configuration.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-database"></i> Flow Table</h3>
    <p>
    Determine a flow tables capabiltiess: number of flows, matching types,
    and instruction/action types. Track table lookups and hit/miss counts.
    Model a vendor's flow table with precise cababilities.

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-list"></i> Flow</h3>
    <p>
    Experiment with capturing and manipulating packets through flow
    configuration. Track flow statisitcs and manage flow lifecycle explicit 
    explusion, inactivity timeouts, and absolute timeouts.

    <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-th"></span> Port</h3>
    <p>
    Ports are a fundamental abstraction in the OpenFlow protocol. Mimic
    actual vendor switches with specific port counts and capabilities.
    Toggle port status during simulation to see port state changes and
    related OpenFlow messaging.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-crosshairs"></i> Match</h3>
    <p>
    Matches are OpenFlow's fundamental packet classification mechanism.
    Limit a switch's possible classifiers through a profile. Learn the
    details of multi-table flow matching by single steping a packet
    through the classification, or flow matching stage, of the OpenFlow
    data plane pipeline.

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-bars"></i> Instruction</h3>
    <p>
    Limit a switch's possible policies through instruction and action
    capabilities on a profile. Learn the intracacies of instructions and
    actions by watching them in action. See how a packet is manipulated
    based on different instruction and action combinations.

    Limit a switch's possible policies through instruction and action
    capabilities on a profile. Learn the intracacies of instructions and
    actions by watching them in action. See how a packet is manipulated
    based on different instruction and action combinations.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i> Group</h3>
    <p>
    Define a set of egress packet processing behaviors with a defined group. Use
    groups to load balance across targets, select the live target from a high 
    availability group, copy a packet to multiple destinations, or some other
    stuff.

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3><i class="fa fa-align-right"></i> Queue</h3>

    Utilize rich egress queueing mechanisms on a per port basis for egress
    pcaket delivery.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-dashboard"></i> Meter</h3>
    <p>
    Defing a policing or shaping strategy to meter any type of flow in the 
    dataplane. Use a policing strategy to limit flows to specific bandwidth
    cielings with excessive packets being discarded. Or use shapping strategies
    allow for bursts above a defined rate within the constraints of a specified
    queue depth.
