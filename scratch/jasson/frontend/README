Flowsim by Flowgrammable
------------------------

Flowsim is an OpenFlow data plane simulator. The goal of this tool is visualize
and simulate the abstract data plane specified by the OpenFlow switch
specifications.

Global Dependencies
-------------------

* Nodejs    - `install however you wish'
* Bower     - sudo npm install -g bower
* grunt-cli - sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

Build Environment
-----------------

  Preventatives
  =============
  Sometimes the npm environment gets installed with root ownership, which
  causes failures during local npm installs. The error logs suggest to rerun
  your commands but with 'sudo', this is the wrong solution to your problem!
  You must fix your global npm ownership issues. As a preventative step do the 
  following:
  - chown -R `whoami` ~/.npm

  Install your necessary local depenencies

  Build dependencies by hand ..
  - cd bower_components/angular-ui-bootstrap/
  - npm install
  - grunt
  - cd ../..

  .. OR .. build dependencies with grunt
  - grunt init

  Build the debug site
  - grunt

  Build the release site
  - grunt release

  Clean the sites
  - grunt clean           (removes both debug and release sites)
  - grunt clean:debug     (removes debug site)
  - grunt clean:release   (removes release site)

  Run the site locally
  - node_modules/.bin/http-server debug     (runs the debug version locally)
  - node_modules/.bin/http-server release   (runs the release version locally)

  Run a continuous rebuild on watch loop
  - grunt watch           (rebuilds debug directory on src/** changes)

Development

  How to include external dependencies?
  =====================================
  1. Install the dep - bower install <dependency> --save
  2. If necessary build the dep
    * do this by hand at first
    * once you know the procedure add the build instructions
      to dependencies.json file under "init"
  3. Include the dependencies in the depeneccies.json file
    - add the appropriate relative filepath to css/js/fonts
    - be sure to add both release and debug references
  4. Test your work
    - your new depenencies should be automatically added to the index.html
    - test that both the debug and release versions do the following:
      - place your resources in the proper location in release|debug
      - include your new dependencies in the index.html

  How do I add new images to the application?
  ===========================================
  1. Place your images within img/
  2. Reference your images using 'img/path/to/image.png'

  How do I add new javascript to the application?
  ===============================================
  1. Place your javascript anywhere within src/
     - everything else is automatic

  How do I add new style sheets to the application?
