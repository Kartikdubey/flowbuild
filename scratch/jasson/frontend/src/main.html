  <h1>Learn OpenFlow</h1>
  <p>
  Now you can learn OpenFlow using a simple web browser. Flowsim is
  designed to simulate a wide range of standards compliant OpenFlow
  switch profiles. Choose a profile from any version of OpenFlow, or
  customize your own profiles. Watch packets step through the OpenFlow
  switch data plane's pipeline stages and learn exactly what is
  happening.

    <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-th"></span> Ports</h3>
    <p>
    Ports are a fundamental abstraction in the OpenFlow protocol. Mimic
    actual vendor switches with specific port counts and capabilities.
    Toggle port status during simulation to see port state changes and
    related OpenFlow messaging.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-th-list"></i> Classifiers</h3>
    <p>
    Classifiers are OpenFlow's fundamental packet matching mechanism.
    Limit a switch's possible classifiers through a profile. Learn the
    details of multi-table flow matching by single steping a packet
    through the classification, or flow matching stage, of the OpenFlow
    data plane pipeline.

    <h3><i class="fa fa-bars"></i> Instructions</h3>
    <p>
    Limit a switch's possible policies through instruction and action
    capabilities on a profile. Learn the intracacies of instructions and
    actions by watching them in action. See how a packet is manipulated
    based on different instruction and action combinations.
