  <h1>Learn OpenFlow</h1>
  <p>
  Now you can learn OpenFlow using a simple web browser. Flowsim is
  designed to simulate a wide range of standards compliant OpenFlow
  switch profiles. Choose a profile from any version of OpenFlow, or
  customize your own profiles. Watch packets step through the OpenFlow
  switch data plane's pipeline stages and learn exactly what is
  happening.

    Ports are a fundamental abstraction in the OpenFlow protocol. Mimic
    actual vendor switches with specific port counts and capabilities.
    Toggle port status during simulation to see port state changes and
    related OpenFlow messaging.

    Classifiers are OpenFlow's fundamental packet matching mechanism.
    Limit a switch's possible classifiers through a profile. Learn the
    details of multi-table flow matching by single steping a packet
    through the classification, or flow matching stage, of the OpenFlow
    data plane pipeline.
