Packer.io automates the creation of any type of machine image.
You feed it a config file, it will create virtual machines for virtualbox and 
AWS AMI platform. The only reason to use this directory flowsim/packer is if you
need to add more packages to the current development appliance.

1. Download and install packer from packer.io
2. ./packer build flowgrammable_dev_appliance.json
3. A AWS ami will be created and a VirtualBox image will be created...

Note: To build a virtualbox image you must have a barebones virtualbox.ovf 
image. Packer provisions the barebones virtualbox
